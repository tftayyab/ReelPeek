# 🎬 ReelPeek — Movie Discovery App (Work in Progress)

**ReelPeek** is a web app that helps users discover movies quickly and easily using The Movie Database (TMDB) API. With a clean UI and powerful search features, the app will allow users to explore trending titles, search for specific films, and get detailed movie information.
